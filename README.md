**Classification and Detection for Deforestation Patterns using Deep Learning Techniques**
Deforestation is a pressing issue that threatens ecosystems, biodiversity, and climate stability worldwide. As forests are cleared at alarming rates, efficient monitoring methods are essential to track and mitigate the damage. This project aims to create a smart, automated system to detect and classify deforestation, helping protect forests and promote sustainable environmental practices. This study introduces an innovative approach that integrates deep learning techniques with high-resolution satellite imagery to enhance deforestation classification. By employing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for refined classification, and semantic segmentation for pixel-level accuracy, the proposed method effectively captures both local textures and global contextual information from satellite data. The model is trained and validated on a comprehensive dataset comprising multispectral images from diverse geographical regions, ensuring its robustness and adaptability to various forest types and deforestation patterns. To address challenges such as cloud cover and seasonal variations, the study incorporates temporal analysis, utilizing time-series data to distinguish between permanent deforestation and temporary changes in forest cover. The results demonstrate a significant improvement in classification accuracy compared to traditional methods, underscoring the potential of advanced machine learning models in environmentalÂ monitoring.
